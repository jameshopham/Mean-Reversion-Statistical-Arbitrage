# Mean Reversion Statistical Arbitrage
<div>

## Project Overview
In this project, I scrutinize various techniques used in time series analysis to better suit 
quantitative analysis on financial data to perform mean reversion statistical arbitrage
and note the implications of using different techniques including linear and non-linear
approaches.  I then provide a demonstration of using cointegration to improve stationarity
of the model to provide more robust models.
